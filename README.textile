h1. Hydra Plugin Test Host

This is a blank Rails app with Blacklight installed in it.  It is meant to be used as the "host" application when testing Hydra plugins.

The full hydra stack (provided by this app) includes the following:

- Blacklight for the User Interface
- Solr for the Search Engine
- ActiveFedora to let the rails application talk to fedora
- OM to streamline the metadata configuration
- Solrizer to write Fedora content to the Solr index
- SolrizerFedora for something.


h2. Note about Rails2 & Rails3

This tool is currently for testing Rails2 plugins. We might create a version for Rails3.

h2. Installation:

h3. Prerequisites
* ruby v 1.8.7 or higher
* rubygems
* these ruby gems:
** bundler
** rails version < 3.
* git
* java 1.6 or higher


h4.  (0) We strongly suggest using RVM  (ruby virtual machine) as a means of keeping your different ruby applications with their specific gem requirements from having version clashes. 

See https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/

If you don't have the desired ruby version in RVM, e.g. ree-1.8.7, then install it.
<pre>
rvm install ree-1.8.7
</pre>

h4.  (1) Get the code
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:projecthydra/hydra-plugin_test_host.git my-hydra-head-test-app
cd my-hydra-head-test-app
</pre>

h4.  (2) Create an RVM gemset for your local hydra application
The following will create an .rvmrc file, which ensures that this gemset will be used whenever you are in the my-hydra-app directory.
<pre>
echo "rvm use ree-1.8.7@my-hydra-head-test-app --create" >.rvmrc
. .rvmrc
</pre>

You should get a message like this:
 Using /usr/local/you/.rvm/gems/ree-1.8.7-2010.02 with gemset my-hydra-head-test-app


h3.  to TEST the hydra-head app, now refer to README_FOR_HYDRA_HEAD_TESTING


h3.  To start the rails app

<pre>
./script/server
</pre>

This will start the rails app on port 3000.


h3.  Beware

This rails app does not include Solr or Fedora instances.  You might want to go to  README_FOR_HYDRA_HEAD_TESTING.
