h1. Hydra Plugin Test Host

This is an empty rails app to use as the "host" application when testing Hydra plugins.

h2. Note about Rails2 & Rails3

This tool is currently for testing Rails2 plugins. 

h2. Usage

Put a copy of this app into the root of the working copy of your plugin, then add these lines to your spec/spec_helper.rb (or whatever initializes your tests).  If you put gave the test host a different name, be sure to change the lines that reference "hydra-test_host".

<pre>
  require File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../hydra-test_host/config/environment" unless defined?(RAILS_ROOT)

  # Overrides require_plugin_dependency, pointing to plugins within dummy app
  # Original require_plugin_dependency method defined in init.rb
  def require_plugin_dependency(dependency_path)
    modified_path = File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../hydra-test_host/" + dependency_path
    p "requiring #{modified_path}"
    require_dependency modified_path
  end
</pre>
